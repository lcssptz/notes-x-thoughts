# About TDD

> Test Driven Development(TDD) is a technique that comprises of three engineering techniques.

> Design first, writing tests and then refactor with codes

1. Design
   1. Software Design Principles
   2. Software Thoughts
   3. Software Design Patterns
2. Testing
   1. Tesing Techniques
   2. Testing Methods
   3. Testing Tools
3. Refactoring
   1. Bad Smells
   2. Refactor Methods
   3. Tools for refactoring

> Splitting Requirements/Demands

1. Tasks List - Inside-out
2. Tests List - Outside-in

> Red Light(first)

1. Expected Failure
2. If no failures
   1. Tests are wrong
   2. Feature has been implemented before writing tests
3. What red light means:
   1. No feature
   2. Implemementation Failure
4. Purpose: capture expected end results

> Green Light(fast)

1. Focus on end results and passes tests
2. Bad codes or designs due to not enought end results or failure of refactoring
3. Purpose: pass the test with minimum codes

> Refactor(why)

1. Quality codes come from refactoring
2. Refactor on both feature codes and test codes with
   1. Bad smell
   2. Methods
   3. Principles
   4. Thoughts
   5. Tools
   6. Design Patterns
3. Make sure all test are passed, other wise go to refactor
4. Purpose: work for what we did wrong in green light phase
